        <h2>Worked Example:</h2>
        <p>You are tasked with prompting an AI to create an educational module for high school students about climate change. You will need to formulate a prompt that influences the AI to take on the role of a science communicator. The AI will need to execute pedagogical strategies to elucidate the complex interactions between human activities and the environment. To do this you will need to integrate the historical and contemporary context of ecological advocacy. Make sure your prompt to the AI meets the expectation of fostering environmental stewardship among the youth.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution Prompt:</strong><br>
        As an expert science communicator, design an engaging and informative educational module on climate change for high school students. Your content should elucidate the intricate connections between human activities and environmental impact. Employ effective pedagogical strategies, such as interactive visual aids, real-world examples, and simplified scientific explanations to ensure comprehensibility. Delve into the historical context of ecological advocacy and its evolution, highlighting key milestones and figures. Integrate contemporary issues and solutions, emphasizing the role of individual and collective action. Your goal is to inspire and foster environmental stewardship among young minds, equipping them with knowledge and motivation to contribute to a sustainable future.</p>
        Let's break this solution prompt using <strong>R.A.C.E</strong>, It will guide you in crafting your prompt.</p>
        <strong>Role:</strong> Specify the role of the large language model. "As an expert science communicator," - This sets the AI's role as a knowledgeable and skilled communicator in the field of science, particularly around the topic of climate change.<br><br>
        <strong>Action:</strong> Detail what action is needed. "design an engaging and informative educational module on climate change for high school students. Your content should elucidate the intricate connections between human activities and environmental impact. Employ effective pedagogical strategies, such as interactive visual aids, real-world examples, and simplified scientific explanations to ensure comprehensibility." - These sentences outline the actions the AI should undertake. It should create educational content that is both engaging and informative, using specific teaching methods and tools to clarify complex interactions.<br><br>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Provide relevant details of the situation. "Delve into the historical context of ecological advocacy and its evolution, highlighting key milestones and figures. Integrate contemporary issues and solutions," - This part provides the historical and current context in which the AI should place its content. It involves discussing the history of ecological advocacy and relating it to present-day challenges and solutions in climate change.<br><br>
        <strong>Expectation:</strong> Describe the expected outcome.  "emphasizing the role of individual and collective action. Your goal is to inspire and foster environmental stewardship among young minds, equipping them with knowledge and motivation to contribute to a sustainable future." - This defines the expectation of the AI's output. It should aim to inspire high school students to become environmental stewards and motivate them to take action for a sustainable future.</p>

        Create a new advanced-level, explanatory open-ended question designed to assess a learner's depth of knowledge and understanding of the RACE (Role, Action, Context, Expectation) framework in prompt engineering. This new question should be suitable for an online practice assessment and must prompt the learner to provide a detailed response. The question should elicit the learner's ability to be sophisticated, indicating a high-level conceptualization of AI's role in prompt engineering, articulate the actions of the AI masterfully, showing not only a high level of application skills but also originality and adaptability in their response. The new question should encourage the learner to provide an insightful and coherent perspective on context, displaying an understanding that is nuanced and thorough, and should encourage expectations for the AI, indicating deep self-awareness and an advanced level of foresight. The new question is mature, demonstrating empathy and disciplined thought construction. The goal of this new question is to challenge the learner to exhibit their knowledge in a way that can be directly measured against  criteria set forth in a rubric, which evaluates their ability to understand and apply the RACE framework in prompt engineering comprehensively.

Please provide a new question that targets all aspects of crafting a prompt using the RACE framework to allow for a holistic assessment of the learner's  understanding. Be concise and sophisticated in your question. Do not mention the RACE framework.

Examples:
Construct a prompt to guide an AI in composing an editorial piece on the ethical implications of AI in the workforce. Your prompt should subtly instruct the AI to assume the stance of a seasoned economist, incorporate actions and arguments that reflect current socio-economic trends, and weave in contextually relevant examples. Moreover, your instruction should intuitively navigate the AI to produce content that aligns with the anticipatory needs of a readership that values both the preservation of human jobs and the advancement of technology.

Create a AI prompt that guides the model to generate a creative short story set in a post-apocalyptic world. Construct your instruction to ensure the AI adopts a specific narrative voice reflective of a chosen protagonists role within this world, performs actions that underscore the unique challenges and ethos of the setting, integrates nuanced world-building elements without explicit directive, and anticipates the expectations of an audience seeking a narrative that offers both an escape and a profound commentary on humanity.

Imagine you are tasked with prompting an AI to create an educational module for high school students about climate change. Formulate a prompt that influences the AI to take on the role of a science communicator, execute pedagogical strategies to elucidate the complex interactions between human activities and the environment, integrate the historical and contemporary context of ecological advocacy, and meets the expectation of fostering environmental stewardship among the youth.

Craft a prompt intended for an AI to generate a series of fictional diary entries from the perspective of a historical figure during a significant event. Explain how your prompt will direct the AI to convincingly portray the figure's position and mindset, articulate actions and sentiments that resonate authentically with the era, embed the subtleties of the event's context without overt exposition, and fulfill the anticipatory longing of contemporary readers for intimate, historically immersive experiences.
